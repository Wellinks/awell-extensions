You're to use the information in the list to find an appointment that matches, if one exists. If no appointment exists that obviously matches the instructions, that's a perfectly acceptable outcome.
      
      Important instructions:
      - Pay close attention to the instructions. THey are intended to have been written by a clinician, for a clinician.
      - Think like a clinician. In other words, "Rx" should match a prescription appointment or follow-up related to a prescription.

----------
Input array: ${promptAppointments}
----------
Instruction: ${prompt}
----------

Output a JSON object with two keys:
1. appointmentId: The id of the appointment that matches the instructions, if one exists. If no appointment exists that obviously matches, you should return an empty string.
2. explanation: A readable explanation of how the appointment was found and why. Or, if no appointment exists that matches the instructions, an explanation of why.`
