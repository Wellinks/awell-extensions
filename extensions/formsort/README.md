# Formsort

Formsort is a fully-managed form-building platform. Team can use the online studio (a specialized content management system for forms) to create form content, modify styles, and configure integrations.

Formsort hosts your fully-branded forms, either on one of your subdomains or embedded in a page on your site. When responders submit answers, Formsort sends the answers to a destination of your liking directly. Formsort doesn't store the responder's answers.
